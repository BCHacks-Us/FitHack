            <p id='strengthInfo'>Strength training differs from volume training, AKA Body Building, in that you work in more sets for lower reps.  You design your workouts to achieve higher weight, and optimize your rep/set ratio in order to achieve maximum weight lifted, to classically work towards a 1 rep maximum.  Standard rep/set ratio is a 5x5 (5 sets with 5 reps) in which you maintain a steady single weight that is difficult to lift at the beginning, and nearly impossible to finish the last rep on.  This program is classically known as starting strength, and is a good platform for beginning a career in powerlifting/strength training.  Remember, that strength training caps, or 'plateaus' can sometimes be overcome by body building, so if you're stuck at a certain weight, maybe switch up your training. </p>

        <div id='volume' class="col s8 offset-s2">
            <h2 class= "center text-align">What is Volume?</h2>
            <p id='volumeInfo'>Volume training, AKA Body Building, is process of training with sets between 3 and 5 with reps above 6, but less than 12.  Structuring these workouts is designed to make you lift at a weight that is heavy enough to strain you, but still lift with excellent form in order to isolate your muscles and get the 'pump'.  This differs from Strength Training/Powerlifting in the way that you are causing continuous high stress of your muscles for an extended period of time, stretching and flexing them longer.  This causes more 'damage' (muscles tear when you work them) but then leads to greater growth in the physical muscle itself.  Volume training can still be peaked by the individual strength of your muscles, so if you're having trouble getting past a certain number of reps for a certain weight, maybe switch to a strength program and focus on getting stronger before you go back to working for size. </p>
