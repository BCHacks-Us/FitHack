            <h2>What is Strength?</h2>
            <p id='strengthInfo'>Strength is the maximal force you can apply against a load. Training to improve muscle strength includes lifting weights or otherwise increasing the resistance against which you work.</p>

            <h2>What is Volume?</h2>
            <p id='volumeInfo'>
The number of sets and reps you do in a workout is called volume—and thinking of the volume on your stereo helps in understanding how much to use in the gym. If your training volume is too low, your body won’t adapt (you won’t be able to hear the music); if it’s too high, you risk overtraining (blowing the speakers). </p>
